Genlogic is able to:
-Analize linear or circular (plasmids, vectors) DNA sequences.
-Use endonucleases that cleave within a recognition site.
-Use endonucleases that cleave short specific distances from a recognition site.
-Use endonucleases that cleave cleave at sites remote from a recognition site.
-Use endonuclease with degenerated site (one or more base pairs that are not specifically defined).
