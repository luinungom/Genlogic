Genlogic is able to:
- Analize linear or circular (plasmids, vectors) DNA sequences.
- Use endonucleases that cleave within a recognition site.
- Use endonucleases that cleave short specific distances from a recognition site.
- Use endonucleases that cleave at sites remote from a recognition site.
- Use endonucleases with degenerated recognition site (one or more base pairs that are not specifically defined).
- Detects targets in both strands, 5'->3' and 3'->5'.
- Allows the user to insert or delete endonucleases manually.
- Results can be exported as txt or CSV files.
